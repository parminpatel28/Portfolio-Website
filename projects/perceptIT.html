        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
            This project was part of my computer science course in grade 12 because our teacher wanted us to get a glimpse of artificial intelligence.
            </p>

            <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem; ">PURPOSE</h4>
            <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
                The purpose of this project is to decide if a colour(in RGB value) would look better on a black background or a white background.
            </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem;">HOW</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
               The main component of this project is to train the AI using calculations. 
               We need to know what the perceptron calculates which is why I had to use the feed-forward algorithm.
               The algorithm does not tell us if the outputs the perceptron calculates are correct, nor does it allow the perceptron to learn what the correct answers are.
               Supervised learning had to be implemented to ensure that the perceptron generates the correct output. 
               This means that I had to use training data which has both input and known correct outputs to change the weights of the perceptron so that the feed forward-algorithm eventually provides the correct output.
               The purpose of the training algorithm is to ensure that the perceptron makes better decisions.

               The challenge I encountered while working on this project was trying to calculate the precision and recall for the perceptron.
               It's important to make these calculations so you would know how efficient the AI is. 
               The calculations were complexed and it was hard to understand what was going on while coding it. 
               To solve this issue I had to first calculate the precision and recall for both the colours white and black.
               
               through the use of comments, it was easier to break down the code into small blocks and understand it.
               A programmer's best friend will always be COMMENTS!
