        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
                I built this application because I was fascinated by 
                sorting algorithms,
                and I wanted to visualize them in action. 
            </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem;">HOW</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
                Every time the program starts a new set of array is generated in a random order.
                The goal is to sort the array in ascending order using one the the sorting algorithms. 
                There are 3 algorithms that will be randomly choosen by the compiler which will be utilized for sorting the array.  
            </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem; text-transform: uppercase;">Algorithms</h4>
        <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem; text-transform: uppercase;">1. Bubble Sort </h5>
        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
            In bubble sort we start at the beginning of the array, as we interate through the array we swap elements that are beside each other in descending order. 
            Then we go to the next pair and continue the same process coninuously making sweeps of the array until it is sorted.
            in doing so, the smaller items slowly "bubble" up to the beginning of the list. 
            Bubble sort is not the ideal algorithm to use due to the number of comparisions.   
        </p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem; text-transform: uppercase;">2. Insertion Sort </h5>
        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
            As we begin sorting the array we want to keep the left side of the element we are comparing always sorted. 
            When we interate through the array we check if the left side of the element and if it is lower we would swap it until the entire left side is in ascending order.
            After we move to the next index and continue the same process. 
        </p> 

        <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20rem; text-transform: uppercase;">3. Selection Sort </h5>
        <p class="lead mb-5" style="margin-left: 19.66rem; margin-right: 20rem; text-align: left;" >
            Selection sort is a simple but inefficient. Using linear scan we would find the smallest element and move it to the front.
            Then, find the second smallest element and move it, again doing a linear scan. This process is repeated until all elements are in place.   
        </p>

               Ever since I got the idea to make this project my biggest concern was how would I visualize the sorting process.
               I was well aware that I needed to make it using Swing but I didn't know how to utilize Java Swing.  
               When every a programmer has a problem they would usaully look for help on stack-overflow or try to find a tutorial video on youtbue and I did just the same.
               The problem with youtube was that all the videos were using a different language for example JavaScript, I tired to follow along.
               However, due to the lack of experience in a certain language it made it more difficult and confusing.
               I continued to look for books, examples, videos, new languages but nothing worked and I felt like moving on to a new project.
               Few weeks later, I suddenly found a video that taught me how to implement Swing for a sorting visualizer by utilizing the Graphics object. 
               Therefore, not only did this video allow me to solve a major challenges but I was able to do it in the least amount of code possible which made this project the most efficient.
